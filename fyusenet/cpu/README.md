# CPU-based Neural Network Components 

This folder contains CPU-specific components for neural network inference and also buffer
management.

As FyuseNet was developed with running GPU inference on smartphones as primary target, the CPU parts
found here are quite incomplete. You will mainly find buffer management and a few simple convolutions
in this code-base and none of it has been optimized in any way.
